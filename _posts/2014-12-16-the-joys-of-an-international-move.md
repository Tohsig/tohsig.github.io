My intent with this blog was to have a post up every week. Go figure, prepping for moving back to the States right before Thanksgiving and then combining that with a family reunion/birthday party was decidedly hectic. After several weeks and 7 airports, we’re finally home again in MD with all 9 bags. If you’ve never attempted to move this way, don’t. Fun it isn’t. I’m still amazed that all our luggage arrived intact.

Writing will have to wait until I’m caught up on client work and fully set up again back here in the US.
