The "blog as you learn" concept is almost a clich√© amongst programmers. That's either true, or I'm simply bitter that I didn't think to do it back when I started. Regardless, at this point I need a different angle. I'm introducing the "Debatable Advice" tag as a _thing_.

In each of these posts I'll cover a bit of advice that's bandied about. These will cover anything from actual programming to best practices, learning styles, life, etc... Since the area is obviously near and dear to my heart, initially I'll be mostly focusing on topics relevant to new programmers.

I chose the word "Debatable" quite intentionally. My original thought was to use "Questionable." Functional word with a better ring to it, but "Questionable Advice" sounds awfully negative. The goal here isn't "to mock awful advice" so much as it is "to critique potential flaws." Let's face it, I'm just a random fool with a keyboard and a Jekyll install. These will be my opinions. I'm very fond of my opinions. I cultivate them to be as true as possible. But I'm not so fond of them that I'll keep them around if they're wrong. I'd rather find a true answer than cling to a stupid one. Consider this my buffer if you disagree with something I write: I'm inviting conversation.

So "Debatable" it is. The word allows for nuance, and I think we can all agree that's a very good thing.
