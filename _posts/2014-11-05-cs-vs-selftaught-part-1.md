I’m going to start this off with the horrible admission that I have no idea when Part 2 will be. It’s a complex debate that has a few oh-so-right answers for some extreme cases, but most of us fall into the befuddling middle ground of “Well…it depends.” If you’re looking for complete clarity, you’ll have to give me a few years to really gnaw on the issue. For now, here’s my best stab at it for those who are just starting to grapple with whether or not they should self-teach.

## The Gist

The basic advice is this: “If you want to go into CS research, get a CS degree, but if want to *program*, just teach yourself how.” This is usually followed up with at least two of the following:
  
- My friend/relative/spouse/ex-neighbor’s dog taught themselves to program and now they’re making a bajillion super-monies at X company.
- There are so many free resources online, I can’t imagine paying for that information! If I could do it again, I wouldn’t bother with college.
- Sure, CS majors get the theory but they can’t program themselves out of a paper and/or *wet* bag.

The specific phrasing variations on this are endless. If that fact isn’t painfully obvious to you, go read /r/cscareerquestions for 10-15 minutes. This kind of advice is given a lot because it’s *comforting*. It lets any given individual go “Sure, I don’t have a degree, but what the hell do those snobs know?” If you’re going the self-taught route, that’s a great pick me up at the end of a crappy day. 

Problem is, for most people the advice is absolute bull. 

## The College Extreme

A quick tangent. My first post-college job was teaching HS English, so I want to make something abundantly clear. If you’re in High School and are pondering a CS degree and have any love of programming, stop reading this and go do it. You’re currently in the enviable state of being in one of those extremes; don’t waste it. “But what if I’m the next Gates/Zuckerberg/Jobs/Bezos/Galactic Overlord?” Well, A) probably not and B) the fact that you’re even asking the question denotes a certain recognition of the unknown. If you’re not sure *right now* that you’re divinely mandated to program and/or create an earth-shattering software company, then go for the CS degree. You can drop out if you ever find that certainty.[^college]

## Segueing Back

Back on track: Disparaging the value of a proper CS degree is bull.[^bull] Why? Because *good programming is difficult*. There’s a certain element of the internet that seems keen to forget and/or ignore that fact.[^fact] Granted, I think a certain number do so in order to be encouraging to beginners. That’s fair. But the hard truth is that if you want to be anything more than mediocre, you can’t just run through Codecademy and call it a day. 

Experienced devs understand that fact, but it often isn’t stressed enough to beginners. Want to join me on the self-taught route? Great. Here’s some of what you have to do:

- Pick a language: I could write a whole post on this topic alone, but suffice to say that this choice isn’t as clear as “Pick something you like and go with it!” Look, if you’re doing this for a hobby then yes, that holds true. But if you’re looking to actually *be employable* in a reasonable amount of time, you’d better be far more shrewd about the language you select. You won’t find a “right” answer, but there will definitely be stronger and weaker choices.

- Learn your core dev environment: I’m in Ruby/Rails territory. Back when I started, my naive idiot self thought that learning Ruby was simply learning Ruby. Then I heard about RubyGems, then RVM, then Bundler, etc…

- Learn the surrounding tools: These are all the other bits of software that ultimately make your life easier, but that are also initially terrifying. There are few things harder than finding a Git tutorial that makes sense to beginners. I sympathize. If I ever have children, I’ll put them to sleep by explaining why you use ```--bare``` for the central repo. Not to mention things like Homebrew, Sublime Text, and general command-line knowledge. 

- Learn OOP principles: Sure, there’s debate about the validity of some of those principles, and *sure*, we may all be merrily chortling together with Haskell by this time next year, *and sure* this is something that comes with time, but none of that matters. You *must* understand the basics if you’re going to get anywhere.

- Learn Algorithms: Single item on this list, but this is where we get into the meat of what you’re missing out on by going self-taught. Do you *need* to fully understand the common programming algorithms? Perhaps not, but I’ve read nothing to disprove the fact that they’ll make you a much stronger programmer.

That’s a shortened list. I’ve left out other incidental skills that I’ve picked up (e.g. basic server management and general linux familiarity) because those will vary with individual goals, but you get the idea. This is *a lot*. The last two items will be more emphasized in a traditional degree than the others, but on many campuses just being a part of that community means that you’ll probably be exposed to a lot of the first three as well.  

Really, this is the crux of the debate. If you’re self-taught, you have no external support other than what you can find online. If you take the degree, you have professors and fellow students to learn from. The former isn’t impossible, but the latter is generally much, much smoother. 

## Hypocrite!

Yes, I’m a self-taught developer who is recommending getting a CS degree. Sound a bit odd? Perhaps, but I make the suggestion because I’m intimately familiar with the time and energy you have to put in if you’re going to take this route. If you’re not the self-driven type, the experience will not be pleasant. If you *are* the self-driven type, going this way isn’t any less painful. You’re just slightly more likely to succeed. 

But hey, if all this hasn’t scared you off the wilder path, then there *is* an upside: You’re guaranteed to come out the other side as a *very* self-sufficient programmer.

[^college]: Hyperbolic? Yes. True even if we tone down the scope and instead look at the owners of successful, if not earth-shattering, small businesses? Oh yes indeed. Undergrad degrees are well on their way to becoming the new HS diploma. Sure, you can survive without one, but the route is much, much smoother with one. That topic isn’t the focus of this article, but seriously, if you have the opportunity to go to college, take it. Stay in school, kids. Don’t do drugs.

[^bull]: “Proper” in my opinion meaning that you’re taking non-trivial courses on databases and algorithms while still working on creating “real” projects in whatever languages your College chooses to emphasize.

[^fact]: Programmers and non-programmers alike…
